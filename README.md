# Logistic Regression
In this project we will implement logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university. The project is an exercise from the ["Machine Learning" course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) from Andrew Ng.

The task is described as follows:
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams. 

The implementation was done using [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

## Visualizing the data
Before starting to implement any learning algorithm, it is always good to visualize the data if possible.
